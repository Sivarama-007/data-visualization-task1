## Project Description
The project involves creating visualizations for:
- The distribution of gender using a bar chart.
- The distribution of age using a histogram.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-visualization-task1.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd data-visualization-task1
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a sample dataset containing gender and age information. The dataset can be generated from the code provided.

## Code and Analysis
The notebook (`.ipynb`) and Python script (`.py`) files include the code used for:
- Generating the dataset.
- Creating visualizations:
  - Bar chart for gender distribution.
  - Histogram for age distribution.

## Results
Key visualizations from the analysis include:
- **Gender Distribution Bar Chart**:

- **Age Distribution Histogram**:
  ![Age Distribution](age_distribution.png)

## How to Run
1. To run the project, open the `data_visualization.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step-by-step.
2. If using the Python script:
    ```bash
    python data_visualization.py
    ```
